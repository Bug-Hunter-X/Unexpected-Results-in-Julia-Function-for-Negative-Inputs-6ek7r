This repository contains a Julia function with a subtle bug. The function aims to return the square of the input, regardless of sign. However, due to an error in the else block, it returns the negative of the square for negative inputs. The bug and its solution are included in separate files for clarity. The bug is demonstrated with test cases, and the solution provides corrected code.
